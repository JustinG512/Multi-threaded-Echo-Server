# Project Overview

Echo servers are often used to demonstrate and test networked communication. In this assignment, youâ€™ll create an echo server and echo client and evaluate their performance. The purpose of the assignment is to gain some exposure and practical experience with multi-threaded programming and the synchronization problems that go along with it, as well as with writing programs that communicate across networks.  

In this project you will develop a server program that echoes a text message on demand. Your echo server is to be a process that will read sequences of words (sentences) sent by clients. The sentences (text strings), sent by a client computer, will be sent back to the requesting client.
